## Introduction

The **Zomato Review Analysis** project is a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system. The project aims to analyze customer reviews from Zomato and determine their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). This can be useful for businesses to gain insights into customer feedback, improve services, and identify key areas for development.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis of Zomato reviews (positive, negative, neutral).
- Preprocessing of textual data (removing stopwords, stemming, etc.).
- Use of machine learning algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) for classification.
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Zomato reviews collected through scraping or publicly available datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/d4rklucif3r/restaurant-reviews).
- **Contents**: The dataset contains customer reviews, review ratings, and other related information.

### Sample Dataset Structure:
 | Review Text                |  Liked |
 |----------------------------|--------|
 | "The food was excellent!"   | 5      |
 | "Terrible service."         | 1      |
 | "Good but a bit expensive." | 4      |


## Installation

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zomato-Review-Analysis.git
2. Requirements:
   -numpy
   -pandas
   -scikit-learn
   -matplotlib
   -seaborn
   -nltk
   -Flask (if deploying as a web app)
3. Model used:
   - Multinomial Naive Baiyes
     The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is one of the variations of Naive Bayes used primarily for text classification problems. It assumes that the features 
     follow a multinomial distribution, which makes it particularly effective for tasks like document classification or sentiment analysis, where features 
     represent discrete frequency counts such as word counts or term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).
4. Text Preprocessing Steps:
   -Tokenization
   -Stopword Removal
   -Stemming/Lemmatization
   -TF-IDF Vectorization
5. Model Training:
  -Training the model on labeled reviews.
  -Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (usually an 80/20 split).
6. Result:
   Once the model is trained and evaluated, the results will be displayed as:
   -Accuracy: How often the model correctly predicts the sentiment.
   -Precision: The percentage of positive identifications that are correct.
   -Recall: The percentage of actual positives that are correctly identified.
   -F1-Score: A weighted average of precision and recall.
